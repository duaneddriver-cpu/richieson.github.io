    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style, single-page application with a sticky top navigation for smooth scrolling. The structure is thematic to allow for non-linear exploration. It starts with a high-level overview, moves to an an interactive 'Deep Dive' comparison using buttons to dynamically change content, followed by a 'Hardware Guide' with an interactive chart and a pros/cons table, and concludes with a 'Use Case Explorer' where users can click scenarios to get recommendations. This structure was chosen to transform the static report into an engaging, user-driven exploratory tool, making complex comparisons more digestible and task-oriented. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Overview Table (HTML/Tailwind) -> Goal: Inform -> Simple static table for immediate context. 2. Deep Dive Comparison (JS DOM Manipulation) -> Goal: Compare/Organize -> Buttons dynamically update text blocks for focused, side-by-side analysis without overwhelming the user. 3. Hardware Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Goal: Compare -> An interactive bar chart visualizes numerical data, with toggles to switch between min/recommended specs, making data more impactful than a static table. 4. Use Case Explorer (JS DOM Manipulation) -> Goal: Inform -> Interactive cards highlight recommendations for specific user needs, making the report's conclusions actionable. 5. Pros & Cons Table (HTML/Tailwind) -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> A simple table to provide a direct, scannable comparison of software vs. hardware firewall types. -->

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Software firewalls can be installed on standard server hardware, allowing you to scale up resources like CPU, RAM, and storage as your network grows without replacing the entire device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> The initial investment is often lower since you can use existing or commodity hardware, avoiding the premium price of a dedicated appliance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> They are highly customizable through add-ons and packages, allowing you to tailor the firewall to specific needs such as advanced VPN protocols, content filtering, or intrusion detection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vendor Independence:</strong> You aren't locked into a single vendor's hardware or software ecosystem, giving you the freedom to choose your preferred operating system and support model.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                        <li><strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> They may not be as fast as dedicated hardware firewalls, especially for high-throughput networks, because they rely on general-purpose hardware and operating systems that aren't optimized for packet processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complex Setup:</strong> The initial setup can be more complex and require more technical expertise than a plug-and-play hardware appliance. You are responsible for driver compatibility and configuring the base OS.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardware Failure:</strong> A failure of the underlying hardware can bring down the firewall, and you have to manage component replacements, unlike a hardware appliance that can often be replaced as a single unit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> They can consume more power than purpose-built hardware appliances, which are often designed to be highly energy-efficient.</li>
